# **Computer Vision Projects**  

## **📌 About Computer Vision**  
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and analyze visual data from the world, much like the human eye. It involves techniques such as image processing, object detection, facial recognition, and scene understanding, helping computers extract meaningful information from images and videos.  

## **🚀 Building Real-Time Computer Vision Projects**  
Developing real-time computer vision applications involves several key steps:  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Gathering image/video datasets and applying transformations like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  
2. **Model Selection & Training** – Using deep learning architectures (CNNs, ResNet, MobileNet, etc.) or traditional methods (OpenCV, feature extraction) to train models.  
3. **Inference & Deployment** – Implementing real-time prediction using frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, often optimized for edge devices (Raspberry Pi, mobile, etc.).  

## **💡 Real-World Applications**  
Computer vision is widely used in various domains, including:  
- **Healthcare** – Medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs) analysis.  
- **Security** – Facial recognition, surveillance.  
- **Automotive** – Self-driving cars, lane detection.  
- **Retail** – Automated checkout, inventory tracking.  
- **Entertainment** – AR/VR applications.
